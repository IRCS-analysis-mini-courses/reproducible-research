    "**First**, these instructions are oriented towards Unix-like operating systems (i.e. Linux, Mac OS X). If you are running Windows, strongly consider installing a few things to follow along for the first day of the course. [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) is a linux-like environment where you can use linux commands. It is also possible to create a [linux partition](http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html) on your hard drive, which will allow you to keep Windows and get the benefits of a linux distribution. Most notably, a package manager makes everything below extremely easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**, the location of files may vary across operating systems. We'll show you how to determine these locations, but keep in mind where the relevant locations are for your operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Third**, some of the cells below will generate output or install things. These have been left as raw input rather than code. This prevents any drastic changes to your system if you run the entire notebook. If you want to execute them you can copy and paste the commands in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fourth**, and most importantly, getting things up and running is a process. [Google](http://www.lmgtfy.com), [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/), and more specific [google groups](https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/anaconda) will be invaluable. Don't be afraid to ask for help while you're working through things. You might figure things out in the meanwhile, but it never hurts."
